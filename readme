The main file (IvoicingApp) can be used commenting out the lines and execute them to perform the desired action.

Files:

CustomerDatabase = it reads the csv database of customer and performs a series of action
                    like find a customer or add a new one it to the database

CustomerData = is a subclass of customer database, it find a customer and its history
                reading the csv database of invoices

InvoiceData = generate the invoices asking the user to provide some info, it also use the
              class Customer from CustomerData to get the info about customer from the customer database.
              Once an invoice is create, the file stores its relevant information in the invoices database

InvoiceDatabase = It read the invoices database and return a specific invoice using the
                  Invoice class from InvoiceData

Other than that, I've tried to explain what each file does in the comments,
if you have any other questions please ask me.

Moreover, since I have to study also for other exams I have not inserted the data relative to the
[kvk for my company] and the [bankaccount] in the generation of the customers.
However, in the file file CustomerDatabase is indicated where and how this can be done.
If is needed I can add it and upload the other files this weekend.
